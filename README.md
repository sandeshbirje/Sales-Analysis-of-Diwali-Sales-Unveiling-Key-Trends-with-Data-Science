Title : - Sales Analysis of Diwali Sales: Unveiling Key Trends with Data Science

Body :-

I recently conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data, which I sourced from Kaggle. This dataset encompassed over 11,251 products sold during the festive period.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some key insights derived from the data: ðŸ‘‰ 

1. Gender: A significant majority of buyers were female.
2. Age Group: The dominant age group among buyers was 26-35 years.
3. Geography: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka emerged as the top three states with the most orders.
4. Marital Status: Most buyers were married.
5. Occupation: The IT, healthcare, and aviation sectors accounted for a large portion of buyers.
6. Product Category: Food, clothing, and electronics were the most popular product categories.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From these insights, it's clear that our target customer is likely a married woman in the 26-35 age group, working in the IT, healthcare, or aviation sector, and residing in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, or Karnataka.

These findings can be leveraged in several ways:

1.Targeted Advertising:- Businesses can tailor their marketing campaigns to reach this specific audience effectively.

2.Product Development:- Businesses can design products that cater to the needs of this target demographic.

3.Customer Service Excellence:- Businesses can enhance their customer service offerings to appeal to this group.

By understanding our customers' needs and wants better, we can develop more effective marketing and sales strategies. Stay tuned for more updates as I delve deeper into this dataset! ðŸ˜ƒ
